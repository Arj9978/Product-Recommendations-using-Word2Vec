# Product-Recommendations-using-Word2Vec
Welcome to the "Product Recommendations using Word2Vec" repository! üõçÔ∏è
This project aims to provide an efficient and accurate product recommendation system based on the Word2Vec model. Word2Vec is a powerful technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that can also be adapted for recommendation systems. By utilizing Word2Vec's ability to capture semantic relationships between words, we can create meaningful embeddings for products, enabling us to make personalized recommendations to users.

## Key Features

1. **Word2Vec Implementation**: The repository contains the implementation of the Word2Vec model, allowing you to train word embeddings from product descriptions or other relevant textual data.

2. **Product Embeddings**: Learn how to transform product data into dense vector representations using Word2Vec, capturing similarities and relationships between different items.

3. **Collaborative Filtering**: Combine the product embeddings with collaborative filtering techniques to offer recommendations based on user interactions and behavior.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess the performance of the recommendation system using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Scalability**: Explore strategies to handle large-scale product datasets efficiently and ways to optimize the recommendation process.

6. **Customization**: Extend the system to include additional features like user preferences, temporal effects, or item attributes for more personalized recommendations.

7. **Deployment**: Learn how to deploy the recommendation system in a real-world scenario, making it accessible to end-users.
